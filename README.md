# PaintReact
This is a full fledged Paint app written in React. It offers a choice of brush size (default is 6px), 12 static colors, 6 custom colors (and an associated color picker), as well as undo fucntionality and the ability to save your drawsings as PNG. This is still a work in progress. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Dependencies 
it uses a dev version of React (since the app is still in development), [react-rangeslider] (https://github.com/whoisandy/react-rangeslider) for the brush size slider, [react-canvas-draw] (https://github.com/mBeierl/react-canvas-draw) for the canvas element and [react-circular-color] (https://github.com/ubcent/react-circular-color) for the color picker.

```bash
